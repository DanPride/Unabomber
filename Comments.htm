The Unabomber case shaped the attitudes toward environmental issues for decades adding ridicule and derision of the most powerful sort. It is impossible to overstate the infernal and eternal evil of this case and its effects. Backed by the CIA and its linked Petro powers, it provided the margin of difference and then some to elect greenhouse gas promoting George W Bush 4 years later, not environmentalist Al Gore. It went on to provide the basis for much of the anti-environmentalist propaganda and attitudes which have both dominated and debilitated ecological debates since, Eco-Nut, Eco-Terrorist, Tree Hugger, Enviro Wacho etc etc. It molded the debate, and reinforced and enabled environmental degradation at every level, including those to limit greenhouse gas output. It sheltered oil company profits from the potential impact of the environmental movement. The perpetrators of this penultimate crime against humanity bear much of the responsibility for the murder of not just one human or a few or six million, but of all life, and most likely forever. They are central figures in the silencing of the songbirds of earth... forever. As heat waves rapidly enter the 120s, 130s and 140s, and we have our first mass death of thousands in a major city somewhere in the world only then will the world stop laughing, and examine this case with the detail and the horror it so richly deserves.

<br><br>If YOU want the details,...and the proof,... Search for Unabomber Morph and you will see that the first of the Unabomber most-wanted sketchs was computer morphed from Ted Kaczynski's Berkeley Photograph, the sketch it produced was hosted on the NAIC NASA server that created the morph process in the 80s, and the FBI Agents got their emails on the same server. When NASA scientists saw this they were afraid of becoming targets, and panicked and complained and the Washington Post printed the story. The sketch, its photo source, and the post article all reside at your local library for easy confirmation. When you look at the sketch and the photo side by side the relationship is undeniable. You can’t create the wanted poster from the suspects photo seven years before the arrest and then claim you did not know who he was. Will we see justice for the billions about to die in soon-to-be killer heat waves, and the trillions who will never be born? Or are we going to go along and get along for the few years we have left? God is watching.

<p>And if you want the details of the above comment its on line. Google Unabomber Morph and you will see that the first sketch was computer morphed from Teds Berkley Pic, the sketch it produced was hosted on the Same NAIC NASA server that created the morph process in the 80’s, and the FBI Agents got their emails on the same server. When NASA scientists saw this ten years later they were afraid of becoming targets, and panicked and complained and the Washington Post printed the story. The sketch, its photo source, and the post article all reside at your local library for easy confirmation. When you look at the sketch and the photo side by side the relationship is undeniable. You can’t create the wanted poster from the suspects photo seven years before the arrest and then claim you did not know who he was !!!</p>
