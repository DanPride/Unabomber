<p class=story><b>Sean (Shawn?)</b> (Possibly Collins)(20's) <b>Assumed Deceased</b> -Sean was a
part time resident in the Bohlman Road property with his girlfriend Reann. He
would periodically use tools and other items from the garage. Shawn had a
tattoo, which said "Pure Wood" on his left arm. He stated that the tattoo
was related to a furniture shop where he had worked. When he moved out of the
residence, it was on very bad terms with Dettling. Dettling accused him of
stealing tools from the Garage specifically including an oxyacetylene torch. In
the late spring of 1993 Sean was involved in an auto incident in Palo Alto area
where he ran from the scene. The auto involved may have been Reann's mustang.
Sean is shown in a photo with Hren sitting in Dettling's garage during the
wooden gear party. <a href="News/94-12-18-NYTL-NathanTestingSeanAngelak-1.htm#UBID">The
individual with the SS# disappeared shortly after being interviewed by the FBI</a>,
but probably discussed the incident with friends. Sean had difficulty staying
out of trouble for even a few months at a time. Assuming that the
individual is Sean and he is still missing after 7 years...the circumstance of
his disappearance would require closer examination for the possibility of foul
play. If Sean connected the events and evidence he observed whilst &quot;casing&quot; the 
garage with Dettling during the FBI interview...???&nbsp; In the spring of 1993 Sean was employed by a local tree cutter/firewood
provider in Saratoga who owned property in Saratoga and was a regular at the
Bank Bar. <a href="WGP/WGP02index.htm">Photo 02</a> <a href="WGP/WGP05.htm">Photo 05</a>

 </b>(but not listed in SS 
death index)<b>- </b> Computer programmer, habitue of the 
Bank Bar, alcholic. He worked for Marcus Bryant for a short Time. Found dead of an unexpected Heart Attack 
at his families home the morning after a visit from Marcus Bryant. Officials cremated his body the same day against his 
parents expressed wishes, they were suspicious (Doug's sisters opinion, reasons unknown). No autopsy was done despite his parents explicit 
demand, the body was already cremated when they arrived at 3PM. Doug may have been attempting to report details to authorities following 
an extensive conversation with myself during which <a href="Nighthawks.htm">he recalled seeing
Nighthawks</a> and the <a href="http://www.unabombers.com/#Methane">&quot;Shit on speed incident&quot;</a> 
among many other details. Note-I also had a Heart attack in 1996 in Seattle
Washington under circumstances which I consider to be highly suspect. The
unidentified individual, whom I suspected of involvement, showed up again in the operating room
(Capitol Hill Facility) while I was on the gurney in civilian clothes being shown around like a VIP by
a supervising nurse.</p>

Dick, a patron of the Bank Bar who often argued with Dettling. John appears 
to have a poor memory and appears to recall little. Jackie's memory is quite sharp. 
While Jackie acknowledges a number of details (Nov 2000) she does not believe Dettling to 
be involved in bombings. (Note - This site presents corroborated factual details not conclusions, 
while the number of matching details is definitely troubling, by design conclusions are left to the

<p class=story><b>Melanie</b> -&nbsp; Possibly Deceased - girlfriend of Dettling's. She was a
former beauty queen and a former girlfriend of a 49er (She had a super bowl
ring on her fireplace mantel). She worked as a barmaid at Los Altos Bar and
Grill in the spring of 1992. (Tel circa 1992 408-737-8552)&nbsp; During the spring of 1993 when Dettling was in jail for 30 days on DUI, Melanie
visited J-Ray in Jail. Melanie was J-Rays companion for extensive periods of
time. She is believed to have been present during the retyping the Manifesto, and not known
what he was actually doing. She gave him an oversized Mickey Mouse watch with a
gold-circled watch face which he showed off prominently. Prior to that Dettling
wore a watch with an eagle on the face (dark brown reddish wings with gold trim around the outstretched wings and
gold tracing for feather lines) which may be agency related..</p>

among them, he used the name Kaczynski repeatedly one day in my 
presence, in a pointless manner. Background currently not researched. Drove a bright red Vet,
shiny, new, expensive. Computer shop was small operation with very few

<p class="story">The VanPac box on Dettling's desk was addressed to a Judge but I 
can not identify the name. At one point, wondering why Dettling had not mailed 
his package, I leaned over to look at the address. While I can not identify the 
name on the box, I can recall looking around at my surroundings and thinking 
that it made sense that the owner would be communicating with a person of the 
status of a Judge. I assumed that it must have been related to one of his 
inventions, and went about my work on the computer. It was a southern address, 
which surprised me a little, as I had thought there was a specialized Patent 
Judiciary that was based in Washington DC.</p>
<p class="story">The Wooden gear was featured in a television special on Unabomber 
evidence shortly after Kaczynski's arrest. I have been able to find no other 
specific reference to it since, which I find curious, however there are 
several <a href="News/93-07-12-NYT2-RickyTims-1.htm#Handle">references of a similar pattern</a>. I viewed the special 
on cable during a period 
when I was attempting to report details of the case from a very remote location 
to an increasingly hostile FBI. 
There had been extensive work on the Cable system directly outside my location 
in the weeks before, although there were never any problems with the cable I was 
aware of, nor subsequent changes in service. (Ref: Luckiew).</p>
<p class="story">The Gelernter switch is made out of a hollowed out block of wood that 
matches the floor wood blocks in the front game room above the pool on Bohlman 
Road.&nbsp; I suspect a number of elements from the devices such as green panel

Guess). Construction used a number of eccentric things such as copper nails on 
finish wood.</p>

<p class="story">Dettling's Car was a rare model which I have not been able to

independent something or other (air suspension) ? Please email if name make and 
model known.</p>
<p class="story">The garage contained <a href="News/96-04-04-SFC-GroovesInDowels-1.htm#Grooves">several
1&quot; round wooden dowels with machine cut groves on both sides</a> which resided near the
black painted cardboard box towards the garage door on the kitchen side of the
blue tarp covered mound. The groves were deep straight sided pizza shaped groves. One dowel of approximately 2 feet in length
had a T shaped contraption at the end of the dowel constructed of 2 pieces of
wood (1&quot;x1/4&quot; x8&quot;). Bare stiff silver-colored solid
thin wires went down
the groves and threaded through the T contraption at the end. Small wheels
possibly of wood adorned the two outer ends of the T piece. Note: The length
exceeded the descriptions of most of the bombs.</p>
<p class="story">One evening while waiting Rays old Mac2 to compile an index,
I was examining the stamps in the Desk Drawer out of boredom. Upon noticing
Yosemite on the stamps I realized I was only hours away and thereupon decided to
(and later did) take a short vacation to see Yosemite. This was of great
assistance in solidly identifying the stamps as issue #2280.</p>
<p class="story">&nbsp;Note: It is my intention to take an
additional polygraph exam on the clarity of my recognition of the Gelernter
switch in the near future given the importance of the issue...and I fully
anticipate passing it (3/1/2001).</p>
<p class="story">The garage contained a dark square metal plate
(2&quot;x2&quot;x1/4&quot;) with a lighter colored thin pencil width rod vertically welded
to its the center. This seems to match the Endplate design in the VanPac 
devices.</p>
<a id="FirestickBar"> </a>
<p class="story">My knowledge of the details of the Firestick incident in New York 
is from a conversation with one of the officers who actually handled the 
incident. During the time when I worked in New York I frequented a pub on 8th 
and 34th which was also a regular stop of the Midtown Police department. During a visit 
to New York/Stamford Hospital in early 94 or 95, by odd coincidence, an officer I knew and occasionally 
drank/traded stories with told me of the incident, describing the device in detail. 
(Great stories). Eight 
months later, I first learned I was involved in Unabom, years later I figured 
out what the photo actually depicted. In the melee following 
flight 990 in 1999, I again returned to 8th &amp; 
33rd/34th and completed the circle. At the time I was hysterical thinking that 
&quot;Dettling did it&quot; and those bodies in the sea were my failure to get my reports 
heard. The photo of me and Dettling holding the Firestick created a sensation 
among the officers who were familiar with the incident and went immediately to a 
high ranking superior who made a special trip to the bar immediately to get it. That was 
the last I heard of it. Life is indeed strange at times. I can not recall the 
name of the officer I used to enjoy trading stories with, but many of his 
stories were about &quot;Taking back the street&quot; when he came on duty in the area 
around Madison Square Garden. Sure hope he survived 9/11.</p>
