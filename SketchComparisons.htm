The accuracy of Jeanne Boylan's Unabomber sketch 
(the last/final sketch) helps to expose the FBI's Unabom Charade. 
Evidence Planting, fabrications,  lies, and the witness objections to the frame-up are 
revealed by the FBI reactions to the three sketches.
<b><a href="BoylanOnWitness.htm#Optimism"> The witness 
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> demanded a new sketch for seven years</span></a></b> and for the seven years prior 
to Boylan's sketch <b>the FBI refused</b>. They already
had the sketch they wanted...and the sketch they wanted...the one the witness
flatly rejected... looked a great deal like Ted Kaczynski</p><br>

<p class="quote" align="center">Close examination of the early FBI sketches reveal 
deeply troubling details. Comparing the top left (University) photo and the early sketches... 
Shadow marks on the forehead are very similar between the 
university photo and both sketches. The shadow marks on the neck are nearly identical in
all three. The crease on the right side of the nose is hidden in shadow in the photo, and
does not appear in the either sketch. Shadow marks on the chin in both
sketches seem to mimic the dimple in the photo. The break in the tousle
of the hair appears similar in all three. The hedge from the right ear
in the photo seems to briefly appear in the same place in the left sketch between the hood and the jaw line.
Straight dark lines in the extreme upper right of the face in the left sketch seem
derived from the window bars in the photo. Were the FBI sketches computer influenced in some
manner by the one photograph of the suspect/patsy... which was sure to be released in
the media... to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> increase post arrest recognition by the public ?</span></p>

When the witness finally got her new sketch...the FBI resisted using it...until the witness forced the issue</p>
<br>
<p class="quote" align="center">
The clear hint of a dimpled chin is particularly interesting. If the witness is ever identified
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> and still alive</span> (?), her evaluation of the original FBI sketch artist
behavior could be interesting in this regard (if not a basis for prosecution). Did they
repeatedly attempt a dimpled chin ? Did she object ? Is active
participation in an intentional frame-up a prosecutable offense ? Even if you
are a Fed ?</p><br>

He pulled out the 1987 Unabom case composite of a
pointy-chinned, ruddy-faced, redheaded, blue-eyed man with a mustache, wearing
a hooded sweatshirt. &quot;This is the image we want you to correct. It's the
only thing we've had to go by, but from the day we first released it, we've had
an <a href="BoylanOnWitness.htm#UnhappyWitness">unhappy witness</A>. She's maintained that this is not the right face. We need
you to reinterview her and find out what went wrong.&quot;</p>
<p class="quote" align="center"><a id="Optimism"></A>
&quot;The reason for <a href="BoylanOnWitness.htm#Optimism">optimism</a> is, ironically, the
eyewitness's aggravation over the last sketch. That frustration might have
helped lock in her original memory at a subliminal level no matter how much
contamination the image has since been exposed to.&quot;</p>
