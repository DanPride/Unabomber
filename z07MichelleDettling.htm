<h1 align="center">Judge Robert Vance's murder linked to Unabom<br>
An expose of the FBI's Unabomber Cover-up includes Links to the 
murder of alabama Judge Robert Vance and the Atlanta bombings of the 
NAACP.</H1>
<p class="intro" align="center">Unabom was the first in a series of bogus 
terrorist cases supporting intelligence agency budgets and political agendas. It was the largest and 
longest running terrorist case in US history. Unabom killed only three 
people, but generated <span style="text-decoration: underline;">thousands</span> of &quot;terror&quot; headlines. The logic behind Unabom was that bombs create headlines, and headlines enlarge budgets. Unabom is the start 
of the path that leads to 9/11 and the Iraq war. Understanding Unabom provides 
in depth insight into the activities of the FBI and CIA before September 11th 2001. Activities that 
included the <b>manufacture</b> and <b>management</b> of a
series of high profile, random terrorist events and selective assassinations. The
facts of Unabom have been covered up in a blizzard of ridicule akin to Kennedy's 
grassy knoll. Covered up, despite a wide trail of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">undeniable proof</span>
and multiple witnesses.<br>
They are presented here.</p>
