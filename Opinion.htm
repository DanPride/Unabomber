	It is impossible to overstate the <b>infernal and eternal evil</b> represented in the Unabomber case. 

	It shaped the attitudes toward environmental issues for decades adding ridicule and derision of the most powerful sort.  

	Backed by the CIA and its linked Petro powers, it provided the margin of difference and then some to elect greenhouse gas promoting George W Bush

	4 years later, not environmentalist Al Gore. It went on to provide the basis for much of the anti-environmentalist propaganda and attitudes that 

	have both dominated and debilitated ecological debates since... Eco-Nut, Tree Hugger, Funny (not to be taken seriously) environmentalists, etc etc.

	It debilitated efforts to limit greenhouse gas output, and largely shielded 

	oil company profits, as intended, from the environmental movement with a cloud of manufactured ridicule, irrelevance and indifference. 

	The perpetrators of this penultimate crime against humanity bear much of the responsibility for the murder of not just one human or a few or six million, 

	but of all life, and most likely forever. They are indeed central figures in the silencing of the songbirds of earth... forever. 

	 As heat waves rapidly enter the 120s, 130s and 140s, and we have our first mass death of thousands in a major city somewhere in the world...

	 only then will the world stop laughing, and examine this case with the detail and the horror it so richly deserves. 

	 Will we see justice for the billions about to die in soon-to-be killer heat waves, and for the trillions who will never be born...  

	or are we going to go along and get along for the few years we have left? God is watching.
