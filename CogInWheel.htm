<p class="intro " align="center">A Discussion of Michael Hrens tape recorded comments<br>
as the reluctant witness in the unabomber case.</p><br>

<p class="story" align="center">The phrase Michael Hren is struggling to repeat is from the 
second paragraph of the Manifesto. He only got through the first page before I 
interrupted him to try and find the Kill sentence to show him in the moments 
before Dettling walked into the room. The sentence is an interesting one for him 
to remember. In addition to his role managing plastics design and the Model 
Shop, Michael ran the Corporate parties at Apple, a venerated social 
tradition at Apple of the elite. I wonder did he remember the sentence &quot;reducing 
human beings to mere cogs in the social machine&quot; because he disagreed or because 
he agreed from his unique perspective in corporate America :).</p>

<p class="detail">2. The industrial-technological system may survive or it
may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve 
a low level of physical and psychological sutfering, but
only after passing through a long and very painful period
of adjustment and <a href="http://www.Unabombers.com/#Manifesto">
only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to
engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine.</A>
Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences
will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or
modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving
people of dignity and autonomy.</p>

<p class="story" align="center">The voice snipet is from a long conversation which I recorded with Hren without his knowledge.
During the first half an hour of the conversation he remembered and recalled almost every detail attributed to him on the witness page in great and exact detail. 
I was literally steering the conversation from a list I had created of incidents I knew he had witnessed and checking them off.</p>

<p class="story" align="center">But then I discovered the tape was not recording and in my clumbsy and panicked efforts to start it, made him suspicious.  
His subsequent comments, where I am directly and aggressively asking him to repeat all of which he just said, with a discernible tape noise in the conversation,
the only comments I got on tape, reveal a wary Michael Hren, but one who still remembered and spoke in detail of many significant details. Michael became unlocatable shortly after the conversation, 
as happened with others I contacted. </p>

<p class="story" align="center">Doug Gondor, Grants Pass, got a visit from Dettling associate Marcus Bryant shortly after our conversation, and was found dead
by his family the next morning. The family was suspicious, and demanded an autopsy, only to find out the body had already been creamated when they arrived at 
the coronors office in Grants Pass at three oclock on the same day. Doug was an alcoholic (and a generous, caring and honorable human being) 
whom Marcus Bryant often made fun of,... the relationship did not appear to be of the nature that would induce a 500 mile trip for a visit.</p>
