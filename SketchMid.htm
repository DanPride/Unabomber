<p class="quote" align="center">Before computer morphing was a generally known technology the FBI used the process to create a most wanted poster 
from a suspects photo, and then had it published in magazines around the world!!! Numerous copies of both the sketch and its photographic origin now sit on the shelves of your local library !
</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">Evidence of Morphing in the middle of the famous most wanted poster include: </p>
<a id="PhotoBlemish"></a>
<p class="quote" align="center">
<b>1) The Blotchy areas underneath the left eye</b>. &nbsp;<a href="SketchArrow.htm">[<b>Enlarge</b>] </a> 
The Photo has a blemish in the 60's era film in a general left arrow shape. The morph software was confused by the blemish in the film and included it in the sketch as a hazy left arrow blotch.</p>
<a id="LeftEye"></a>
<p class="quote" align="center">
<b>2) The bright left ear/dark right ear colorations</b>  &nbsp;<a href=#TOP>[<b>Top</b>]</a>.  
The dark right ear blur in the sketch nearly exactly matches the shape and pattern in the Photo's right ear shadow. The photos sunlight left ear appears as a bright spot of the same shape in the sketch.</p>
<a id="MouthLines"></a>
<p class="quote" align="center">
<b>3) The facial lines on both sides of the nose/mouth</b>. &nbsp;<a href="SketchNose.htm">[<b>Enlarge</b>]</a>
 The Photos left facial line is in sunlight 
and the right side is hidden in shadow. The sketches left line shows but the right 
line is missing. 
<a id="RightEye"></a>
</p><p class="quote" align="center">
<b>4) Two subtle light color splotches above and below the right eye </b>. &nbsp;<a href="SketchEye.htm">
[<b>Enlarge</b>]</a>. Bright spots, one on the top and one on the bottom eyelid just to the right of the 
pupil center appear in the photograph and are again 
represented in the sketch.
<a id="WindowBars"></a>
<p class="quote" align="center">
<b> 5) Photo's Window bars are actually embedded in Sketches forehead !!!</b>. &nbsp;
<a href="Sketchbars.htm">[<b>Enlarge</b>]</a>. Almost 
humorous if it wasn't so blatant, the morph process embedded the photo's window 
bars in the sketch's forehead area. The Morph process was confused by the similar dark color of the 
window bars, forehead shadow, and hair color (in the photo), and using the shape 
similarity of the hood and the hairline, it mathematically assumed the bars were 
part of the forehead boundary and included them in the sketch. See also: &nbsp;

<p class="quote" align="center">The Early 80's Unabomber sketches released
by the FBI, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">via NASA</span> were morphed from Kaczynski's Mid 60's Berkley University Photo. But the FBI 
<b>claims</b> they didn't know who he was until
seven years later just prior to the arrest!</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">The morphing technology, used to create the early bogus Unabomber 
sketches, was originally developed at the NASA/National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center &nbsp;
<a href="http://www.naic.edu/">[NAIC]</a> 
images group. The process evolved from shooting 20 pictures of a star and comparing them to
 eliminate atmospheric distortion. It was the pre-Hubble solution to atmospheric distortion. 
 <p class="quote" align="center">The first Unabomber wanted poster in cyberspace was hosted 
 on a NASA NAIC group server &nbsp;<a href="News/95-05-07-WP-UnabomNasaLink-1.htm#Patents">[Washington Post]</a>&nbsp; 
 The servers internet address was, being rather obvious...,&nbsp; &quot;<b>http://naic.nasa.gov/fbi/</b>&quot; (see at bottom of article). 
 They later clumsily tried to <a href="http://unabombers.com/UBWantedPageRecord.pdf">erase its existance</a>, 
 compromising the internets wayback machines integrity, and forgetting <a href="http://unabombers.com/UBWantedPageErased.pdf">meta records</a>
  and numerous newspaper articles referenced the page. The FBI agents in the case got their email through a NASA
 <b>naic</b> email address &nbsp;<a href="News/95-05-07-WP-UnabomNasaLink-1.htm#Patents">[Washington Post]</a>, and 
 Dettling's <b>NASA Patent</b> &nbsp;<a href="http://www.unabombers.com/Patent%204,146,180.htm">
 [4,146,180]</a> 
 also traces him to NASA. Four common points in the frame-up all trace to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
 the same obscure place</span>, five common points when you include the distribution of the technology at the time and the date of the 
 morphed sketch!! </p>
 <p class="quote" align="center">Patents were used for years for a paper trail 
 cover for &quot;black&quot; operations <span style="text-decoration: underline;">payments</span> by the CIA to avoid complications with 
 IRS etc. For example...when the IRS asked &quot;Where'd ya get the million 
 bucks?&quot;.... &quot;For Murder&quot; was not an acceptable paper trail for a 
 CIA operative. Over the years they used Patents instead...until recently, the 
 most confusing and intractable paper source in existence.</p>
 <p class="quote" align="center">At the time of the sketch the Public would <i>not hear the word morph</i> 
 nor understand what it was for several years. It was an obscure NASA 
 technology. The perpetrators had no way of 
 knowing that two years later talk show host Johnny Carson would be morphing 
 President and Mrs. Reagan on late night TV for laughs. They had no idea that two short years after the sketch gets printed, 
 millions of television viewers were going to get a crash course in the finer 
 details of computer morph technology.<br> <b>Ooooooops !&nbsp; :)</b></p>
<p class="quote" align="center">You can not create a suspect wanted sketch using the suspect's photo then claim you did not know who he was for another seven years. 
It is logically impossible and it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">conclusively proves a frame-up</span>. Between the morph and the arrest are seven years of public deception, four bombings, and two murders!
