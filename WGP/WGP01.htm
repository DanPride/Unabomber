<p class="header">Photo taken during the ""Wooden Gear Party" in Dettlings 
Garage and Workshop surrounded by proto type samples of virtually every known Unabomber device. </p>

A Firestick incendiary is soaked in a chemical then placed in a bucket containing 
another chemical. When the stick is later withdrawn from the bucket the two 
chemicals mixing with the air cause spontaneous ignition. The ferocious flame
spatters burning metal drops which pass quickly through skin and bone causing 
debilitating burns. One individual was 
<a href=http://www.unabombers.com/News/94-12-22-USA-Subway%20Bombing-1.htm#BombParts>
severely burned</A> (Paralyzed according to 
the <a href="../Witnesses.htm#FirestickBar">investigating officer</a>) in a Firestick attack in New York City
 fitting the dual pattern and timing of Unabom attacks. Just prior to this photo being taken Dettling 
 put down the clipboard he had been using as a prop, and with the gleeful exclamation "Oh lets use this", 
 picked up the bat, poked me in the ribs with it saying, "burn baby burn" just prior to holding it like a giant match for the photo. 
Fascinating to me, given the circumstances of the photo, Dettling's left hand displays a 
Nero like "thumbs up" (as in stick the sword up the guys behind), while mine&nbsp; form a 
Constantine <a href="http://www.request.org.uk/main/history/romans/constantine.htm">Chi-Rho  symbol</a> (Conquer by this)... 
with the wine glass's right side forming the off center P with the tension contorted hands forming the X.</p>
