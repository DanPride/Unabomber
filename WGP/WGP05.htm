Michael Hren, Apple Computer Model Shop director and Shawn, a petty thief, at the Wooden Gear Party held in the real Unabomber workshop where most of the Bombs were made. 
Both individuals are currently unlocatable and assumed deceased. Michael's voice is recorded on this site recalling a number
of details from the case. Shawn is believed to be the individual who's social security number was used as
the Unabomber ID. According to press reports the individual whos social security number 
matched the Unabomber ID was detained and questioned, and promptly dissapeared. Shawn had
spend a great deal of time in the Garage where evidence was piled in a huge pile in the garage, and 
may have remembered too much in the interview to be allowed to survive. Press reports indicated the 
individual had a "Pure Wood" tatoo, which shawn also had.
