<h1>David Gelernter and Epstein <a href="Switches.htm">Bomb switches</a> identified from a
California Garage. More evidence surfaces which casts doubt on the source of the
1993 bombs</h1>
<p class="intro">Unabom was the first in a series of bogus 
terrorist cases supporting intelligence agency budgets and political agendas. It was the largest and 
longest running terrorist case in US history. Unabom killed only three 
people, but generated <span style="text-decoration: underline;">thousands</span> of &quot;terror&quot; headlines. The logic behind Unabom appears to have been that bombs create headlines, and headlines enlarge anti-terrorist budgets. Unabom is the start 
of the path that leads to 9/11 and the Iraq war. Understanding Unabom provides 
in depth insight into the activities of the FBI and CIA before September 11th 2001. Activities that 
included the <b>manufacture</b> and <b>management</b> of a
series of high profile, random terrorist events and selective assassinations. The
facts of Unabom have been covered up in a blizzard of ridicule akin to Kennedy's 
grassy knoll. Covered up, despite a wide trail of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">undeniable proof</span>
and multiple witnesses.<br>
They are presented here.</p>
