<h1>The accuracy of Jeanne Boylan's sketch helps expose <br>the FBI's Unabomber Cover-up.</h1>
<p class="intro"><a href="http://www.unabombers.com/SketchSourceBoylan.htm">Did 
Boylan alter the Patsy's photo in her book?</a></p>
<p class="intro">Understanding Unabom provides 
in depth insight into the activities of the FBI and CIA before September 11th 2001. Activities that 
included the <b>manufacture</b> and <b>management</b> of a
series of high profile, random terrorist events and selective assassinations. The
facts of Unabom have been covered up in a blizzard of ridicule akin to Kennedy's 
grassy knoll. Covered up, despite a wide trail of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">undeniable proof</span>
and multiple witnesses.<br>
They are presented here.</p>
