<h2><a href="SketchMid.htm">The Morphed Sketch</a></h2>
<h2>Welcome to 1984 a little bit late.</h2>
<p class="intro">
The computer generated sketch and the photo it was based on have appeared 
in print in a number of places (See below). They were widely available on 
the Internet until recently. Both are now completely absent from the Internet as 
are all images of the <a href="NathanRNote.htm">Nathan R note</a>. They have even disappeared 
from sites purporting to be &quot;Historical Records&quot; of the Internet.

<p class="intro">
The  sources of the images which appear on <a href="http://www.unabombers.com/">Unabombers.com</a> 
was the site 
&quot;Redacted.com&quot; by a CIA shill named Bill Adams. The site was quoted by major 
media everywhere as 
&quot;authoritative&quot;... God Bless arrogance, it made all this possible. Redacted went 
off the air shortly after I discovered the morph, then enlarged and reposted the images. No problem, I just 
linked to the Government supported &quot;Archive.org&quot; the supposed &quot;Historical 
Record&quot; of the internet.&nbsp; A short time later Archive.org also blocked 
access to its historical 
record of Redacted.com
<p class="intro">
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19990506031837/www.redacted.com/unadesc.htm">
Archive.org access block</a><p class="intro">
<a href="images/redacted/unadesc.htm">Copy of original Redacted.com</a><p class="intro">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="intro">Additional references in the printed public 
record will be added here as I discover them...and there are many. Fortunately, 
copies are available at garage sales all over the country which is a censorship 
Lords worst nightmare :) The Nathan R note was Front Page New York Times Oct 7, 
1993 and is on Microfiche at every major Public Library.</p>
<p class="intro">The Unabomber case occurred at an unusual 
point in time. The state of technology was changing, the public knowledge of 
morphs was unpredictable, and printed documents were widespread. Should a 
situation like this develop in the future, the erasure of all internet sources 
would become a complete duplicate of events described in 1984. It is something 
to think about. The behavior of archive.org in this case is a public crime 
against the very foundations of our Democracy and a beacon of future dangers we 
all face. The truth of this case MUST be exposed for the benefit of us all.<br>
