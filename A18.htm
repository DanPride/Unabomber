<H1>The Unabomber case played a key role in getting funding support for Echelon. 
Three deaths over 20 years generated 10,000 newspaper headlines and trillions in anti-terrorist
funding. Did the FBI have a role in funding echelon by killing or covering up 
the killing, of American citizens ? </h1>
<p class="intro">Understanding Unabom provides 
in depth insight into the activities of the FBI and CIA before September 11th 2001. Activities that 
included the <b>manufacture</b> and <b>management</b> of a
series of high profile, random terrorist events and selective assassinations. The
facts of Unabom have been covered up in a blizzard of ridicule akin to Kennedy's 
grassy knoll. Covered up, despite a wide trail of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">undeniable proof</span>
and multiple witnesses.<br>
They are presented here.</p>
