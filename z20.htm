<h1>Senator Mitch McConnell</h1>
<h2>Investigating Intelligence abuses ? </h2>
<h3>Try the #1 FBI Conspiracy on the World-Wide-Web !<br>Find out where and how it all started !<br>...and this one has democrats too !</h3>
<p class="intro">Understanding Unabom provides 
in depth insight into the coordinated activities of elements of the FBI, NSA, and CIA before September 11th 2001. Activities that 
included the <b>manufacture</b> and <b>management</b> of a
series of high profile, random terrorist events and selective assassinations. The case explodes the fiction that the FBI and the CIA did not Communicate in high profile cases. Ultimately, it exposes the deep common roots, and the common personnel of many different dirty cases tracing all the way back to Rumsfeld and Cheney's coverup of the Olsen murder during the Ford Administration. The facts of Unabom have been covered up in a blizzard of ridicule akin to Kennedy's 
grassy knoll. Covered up, despite a wide trail of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">undeniable proof</span>
and multiple witnesses.<br>
They are presented here.</p>
