 <p class="detail">Why is the photo of the individual spotted at the Murray bombing never released to the public ? 
Why was the search abandoned so abruptly ? When an individual who matched the description was seen fleeing the video cameras, 
local police certainly had an interest, why not the feds ? 
Sacramento Homicide Detective Gardner's comments on the issue are telling and worth a listen: &nbsp;<a href="Sounds/SoundFiles/GardnerMore.wav">[Phone Interview]</a> 
, More on Gardner's Reactions &nbsp;<a href="Sounds/Garner-No_ID.wav">[Phone Interview2]</a>&nbsp; ). 
Given Dettling's apparent pre-disposition to flaunt evidence in front of
unwitting individuals, an appearance at the last bombing could be considered to
be in character. The age explanation is totally absurd,...even <B>bizarre</B>, as a reason to abandon such a promising lead &nbsp;<a href="News/95-07-08-SFC-Video-PrematureDenial-1.htm#PhotoDucker">[San Francisco Chronicle]</a>.
 Why has the picture of the individual who ducked the video
camera and was the subject of an extensive search by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">local</span> authorities never
been released to the public or the press ?

<p class="detail">To me this is one of the most interesting things to turn up in this very 
weird case. Detective Gardner is obviously a very bright alert perceptive 
officer with an exact recall of events ...who what where and when. The kinda guy 
you hope they would put on your case if somebody bumped you off. </p>
<p class="detail">But But But...the only thing he can't really recall with crystal 
and impressive clarity is the reason they did not pursue the most obvious 
suspect. He remembers who was manning the camera ...but not so clear on why its 
result is discarded without pursuit. </p>
<p class="detail">The lingering doubts and dissatisfactions of an honest man who is feeling 
puzzled about it all still is what I hear.</p>
<p class="detail">In the summer of 1993, when my handwriting, unknown 
to me, had suddently become the center of the search with a million dollar reward.
I suddenly went to great lengths to make it drastically different using a methodical 
block print rather than script. I have no 
conclusive idea why. I was not aware of any outside influence and was not yet 
aware of my own involvement. The change was motivated by an inappropriate emotional 
response to my own handwriting which is of course illogical, nonsensical but nevertheless 
powerfully effective. Re-learning writing at 40 is quite a task involving substantial 
effort toward the goal. I printed for five more years ...even after I figured it 
out (when my Polson banker asked me about it in 1998). How would you derail a 
dedicated Detective from going after his prime suspect after walking through Gil Murray's 
guts all morning with the  secretaries hysteria playing in his ears. Are the ample rumors of 
attitudinal  Mind Control capabilities true ?&nbsp; Can &quot;they&quot; really 
make a judges blood boil every time he looks at the defendant? I don't know. I 
only <b>know</b> that at age 42 I was suddenly overtaken by a strong negative emotional 
reaction to my own handwriting, ...at a very conspicuous time...1 month after 
the <a href="NathanRNote.htm">Nathan R note is found</a> and three months before 
it is released in the New York Times on Oct 7 1993.</p>
<p class="detail">The morning the San Jose Mercury news arrived on my doorstep with 
the Nathan R note on the front page was incredibly memorable. I had been writing and
selling a software product to manage physician referral with some modest success.
Three hospitals had bought the product but sales were a slow process. The paper hit
my doorstep with the normal thump, and as I retrieved it the phone began to ring.
All morning it was one call after another, all of which sounded very interested. It
was the busiest morning I ever had on the project by a factor of 10. In memory
it seems like every time I went to take a break and reach for the morning paper the phone
rang again. It was early afternoon before I finally got a spare minute to open the paper
and read it. I immediately was drawn to the note as very curious, examined it for
a minute or two, without thinking about it really, then went about the rest of the paper.
I can't explain why I did not immediately recognize my own note, it struck me as incredibly odd
and I went about my day. I did not remember the details of the morning until I saw the actual
graphic after I had predicted it would be in my own handwriting. I have no explanation
for this, but it certainly seems noteworthy. What exactly are we dealing with here?
</p>
<p class="detail"> I predict that if the conspiracy 
rumors of attitudinal control capabilities are true and a real capability does exist,&nbsp; Democracy, Justice, 
Truth, the American Way, and the goodness of the American people itself will be
 swamped in its tide of pure unadulterated power.</p>
 
<p class="detail">Was it him ? I don't know. I never got a definitive answer. But I will 
probably keep at this until I do :)</p>
